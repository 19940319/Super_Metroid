This is the Casio (ÉJÉVÉI) 5.4 inch screen (sometimes written as Casio CMV54NTO4P) used in the Interact Gamecube LCD screens, Iomega XBOX screens and a number of portable console mods. You can see it in action with various consoles and computers here. It can run off a standard NES power supply. Below is a pinout for the back 10-pin connection, it is clearly labeled on the PCB which pins are 1 and 6.
