Special Notes:

    Connect pin 16 to pin 11 via 3.3k Ohm resistor. The resistor isn't usually necessary, and +5v on this pin will most often work.
    Audio Input: 0.40 mVrms, > 47K ohms
    Audio Output: 0.40 mVrms, > 10K ohms
    CVBS (Composite Video) in and out: 1 Vp-p, 75 ohms, sync: negative
    Ym Input: Switches RGB to half-brightness, for video overlay (L: < 0.4V, H: > 1V, 75 ohms)
    Ys Input: RGB in/out: (Ground for output, 1V+ for Input (preferred)1))
    All RGB lines: 0.7 Vp-p, 75 ohms
