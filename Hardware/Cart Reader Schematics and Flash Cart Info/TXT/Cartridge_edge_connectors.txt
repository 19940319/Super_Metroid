Definitions:

A0-A15  - address bus A (offset)
BA0-BA7 - address bus A (bank)
/RD - read control line for address bus A
/WR - write control line for address bus A
/CART - set low by console's address decoder when address bus A is accessing memory
	in the cartridge region
/WRAM - set low by console's address decoder when address bus A is accessing memory
	in the WRAM region

/IRQ - a cartridge can pull this low to request an IRQ interrupt on the main CPU

PA0-PA7 - address bus B
/PARD - read control line for address bus B
/PAWR - write control line for address bus B

CIC - the security chip
	(referred to as CIC because that's how it's labeled on cartridge boards)

EXPAND - line is pulled high through a resistor
	the only other thing this is connected to is a pin of the expansion port
	(probably meant to allow cartridges to know if something is in the expansion port)
CPU_CLOCK - I believe this is either the current memory access cycle clock, or it is the
 	current clock given to the CPU core. I need to do more verification to be sure.
	I know that a 21.477MHz signal is given to the main CPU (+peripherals) chip, and
	depending on the current memory access cycle, the CPU core is actually clocked at
	3.58, 2.68, or 1.79 Mhz (divided down from the original 21.477MHz).
	This line connects to the main CPU (+peripherals) chip, which I believe outputs
	this system frequency, probably to allow a cartridge to stay synchronized with the
	CPU's memory access cycles if it needs to. 
REFRESH - This is also some kind of clock I believe.
	I think it is output from the MainChip and connects to the WRAM.  It's probably
	some kind of memory refresh signal.
Audio Inputs - whatever the cartridge puts on these lines will be mixed into the SNES's
	audio output.
