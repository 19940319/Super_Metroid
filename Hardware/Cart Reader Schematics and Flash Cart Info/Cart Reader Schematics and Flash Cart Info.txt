Note:
I've done my best to cross-check my results with other people, and to re-check this information. The following information is solely from other documentation and has not been checked: the outer tabs of the cartridge edge connector (pads 01-04, 28-31, 32-35, 59-62), also pad 18, and the labels of the CIC pins (CIC in data, CIC in clock, CIC out data).

If you find more information, or find an error, let me know,
